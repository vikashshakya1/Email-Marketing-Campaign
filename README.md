# Email Campaign Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to optimize email campaigns by leveraging predictive models to maximize the probability of users clicking on links inside emails. The goal is to improve the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and ensure emails are sent to the most relevant users.

### Key Features:
1. **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models are used to predict the likelihood of users clicking on email links.
2. **A/B Testing**: Validation of model performance through controlled experiments.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extraction and transformation of user and email features to improve model accuracy.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization of model parameters for enhanced performance.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Combine datasets (`email_table`, `email_opened_table`, `link_clicked_table`) into a unified dataset.
- Engineer features such as:
  - User engagement metrics (e.g., past purchase history, open rates).
  - Email characteristics (e.g., email text type, version).
  - Timing factors (e.g., sent hour, weekday).

### 2. **Model Development**
- Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict the likelihood of a user clicking on a link.
- Handle class imbalance using oversampling, undersampling, or class weights.

### 3. **A/B Testing**
- **Group A (Control)**: Randomly sent emails.
- **Group B (Treatment)**: Emails sent based on the predictive model.
- Compare Click-Through Rates (CTR) between the two groups to validate the model's effectiveness.

### 4. **Model Refinement**
- Enhance features with more granular data.
- Use hyperparameter tuning techniques like Grid Search or Random Search for better model performance.
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Results
The project has demonstrated:
- Significant improvement in CTR when using the predictive model compared to random email campaigns.
- Insights into user segmentation, email timing, and personalized content for better engagement.
